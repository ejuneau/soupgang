			<h2>It all started with an idea.</h2>
			<p>Most meal-kit services come from big central kitchens, bringing you ample convenience but no love - we're here to fix that.</p>
			<p>By connecting you directly to humans with a passion for cooking, we make sure you get nourished with passion, at a rate that is completely flexible and adapted to your individual needs.</p>
			<p>Our system is set up to scale humanely, such that your cohort's cooks are compensated more for every new member, while charging less per member.</p>
			<p><b>Here's How it works:</b></p>
        </div>
        <div className="how-it-works">
			<div className="steps">
				<p>Start by <b><Link to="/login" className="inline-link">signing up for an account</Link></b>. You must add your dietary restrictions (if any) and your city.</p>
				<p>When enough people in your area have signed up, a cohort is assigned. Cohorts are defined as any number of <b>diners</b> and at least one <b>cook</b>.</p>
				<p>You will be encouraged to introduce yourself to your cohort - these are real people after all!</p>
				<p>Once the cohort is established, the <b>voting period</b> begins.</p>
				<p><b>Questions that must be answered during the voting period:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<p><li>How many different dishes will be made this month?</li></p>
					<p><li>How many portions of each dish does everyone need?</li></p>
					<p><li>Which dietary restrictions should be accounted for?</li></p>
					<p><li>Do any diners require assistance picking up food?</li></p>
				</ul>
				<p>Questions that are nice to have answered:</p>
				<ul>
					<p><li>Any preferences for which dishes are served this month?</li></p>
					<p><li>Do any diners have  specialty equipment they could lend the cook?</li></p>
					<p><li>Can you share your recipe? (Answer at your discretion, cooks!)</li></p>
				</ul>

			<h2>Pricing</h2>
			<p>Due to the cohort system and the variance of the prices for groceries, it is difficult to give an accurate price for the service that OpenKitchen provides.</p>
			<p>Prices for one month may be higher if there are more complex dishes, fewer cohort diners, or exotic ingredients.</p>
			<p>Here is a general guide that is based on a small, single-cook cohort test in Montr√©al, Qu√©bec (prices in $CAD):</p>
